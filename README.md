### 2. **Use Badges**

Badges are a great way to visually represent the status of your PyPI package. You can use shields.io to create badges for your packageâ€™s version, downloads, license, and more.

Here are some examples of badge URLs you can use:

- **PyPI Version:** `![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/package-name)`
- **Downloads:** `![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/package-name)`
- **License:** `![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/package-name)`

Replace `package-name` with your actual package name.

### 3. **Commit Changes**

After editing the README.md file, commit the changes:

1. Save the changes to the README.md file.
2. Add a commit message, such as "Update profile README with PyPI package information."
3. Push the changes to your GitHub repository.

### Example README Section for a PyPI Package
